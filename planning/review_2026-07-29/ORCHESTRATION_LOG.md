# Tech-debt programme orchestration log

Basis: `TECH_DEBT_RESEARCH_AND_FIX_PLAN.md` @ HEAD `17861bb`, branch `experiment/adaptive-spiral`.
Orchestrator: Fable (session 2026-07-29). Implementation/research: Opus subagents.

## Standing constraints (enforced on every agent)

- **One cargo job at a time** across the whole machine (only 4.1 GB free at session
  start). Parallel researchers get "no cargo"; exactly one cargo-enabled
  implementer at any moment. `pgrep -f "bin/[c]argo"` before every launch.
- **Wanaka is read-only**: `planning/airrun_2026-06-01/wanaka.toml` is user-modified
  in the working tree — never commit it, never revert it, never save over it.
- No behavioral change without its checkpoint (A–E). This session targets only the
  pre-checkpoint merge order: PR-0, PR-1, PR-1a, PR-1b, PR-2, PR-3 + checkpoint
  evidence packs.
- Zero-warning clippy before every commit; targeted tests, never workspace-wide
  `cargo test`.
- Commit per plan slice; `git add` specific paths only.

## Session plan (maps to Task list #1–#11)

| Wave | Work | Agent | Cargo? | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | #1 PR-1a A/M8 semantic annotation | impl-1 (opus) | YES (exclusive) | launched |
| 1 | #2 H1 research TOOL_SCALE_SEMANTICS.md | research-h1 (opus) | no | launched |
| 1 | #3 M1 research MEASUREMENT_DOMAINS.md | research-m1 (opus) | no | launched |
| 2 | #4 PR-1b A/M9 standing-material channel | impl (opus) | YES | after #1 |
| 2 | #5 PR-1 M2.1 e2e tapered sentry | impl (opus) | YES | after #4 |
| 3 | #6 PR-0 measurement contract impl | impl (opus) | YES | after #3,#5 |
| 3 | #7 PR-2 H1 additive semantic API | impl (opus) | YES | after #2, seq |
| 4 | #8 PR-3 H3 explicit resolution policy | impl (opus) | YES | after #7 |
| 5 | #9 Checkpoint A evidence (valley matrix) | impl (opus) | YES | after #7 |
| 5 | #10 Checkpoint B evidence (resolution A/B) | impl (opus) | YES | after #8 |
| 6 | #11 checkpoint package + log | orchestrator | — | last |

Checkpoints A/B are **human review stops** — this session assembles evidence and
stops; no H2 routing behavior change, no shared-helper resolution change.

## Event log

- 2026-07-29: session start. Tasks #1–#11 created. Wave 1 launched.
- research-h1 DONE → `TOOL_SCALE_SEMANTICS.md`. 76 production radius() sites
  (8 need semantic change, 5 doc-only, 63 correctly envelope-locked). ADR:
  additive named methods, NO newtypes; `height_at_radius` already IS the
  profile-clearance query — add no fourth name. H2.6 resolved: large-arc stays
  envelope-relative (arcfit cap parity), collapses to doc+sentry in PR-2.
  **NEW HIGH defect (task #12): tapered pencil `resolve_reference_cutter`
  compares vs SHANK dia → silently SelfReferenced (5th instrument defect,
  goes to H4 ledger, not fixed this session).** Also: ToolDefinition never
  explicitly delegates radius()/cusp_radius() (latent trap for PR-2);
  crease_paths.rs offset-pass count is dead code on tapered (n always 0).
- research-m1 DONE → `MEASUREMENT_DOMAINS.md`. 97 rows; 25 serialized fields
  (sim-trace schema v5 + MCP wire), 76 rename-free; NO area/volume in project
  TOML → PR-0 has zero project-format risk. 4 LIVE HAZARDS (task #13): air-cut%
  two denominators under one name (GUI vs MCP vs docs); part_area_fraction
  bbox-rect denominator; 313/482 still constructible in wanaka decompose
  harness; v3_cascade_ab cell-count-vs-mm² line + overlap double-count in
  build_band_map (H4's territory oracle). PR-0 slice 1 = additive
  MeasurementProvenance; slice 2 = ProjectedXyAreaMm2/SurfaceAreaMm2 newtypes
  with no Div → 313/482 becomes a compile error. **A/M7's mm²/s figure
  (0.476 vs 0.938) is VOID: numerator is centreline 1mm bins, ignores tool
  radius and stock — carry to H4 ledger.**
- impl-1 DONE → **PR-1a COMMITTED `93b43e8`** (A/M8). One shared region_table
  projects BOTH structural spans and semantic items (no silent divergence);
  narration gains `Region mix:` line; 4-test sentry (red-first evidence
  recorded); clippy zero; viz 227/227; 3 --lib failures are the pre-existing
  adaptive3d known reds (stash-verified). Adjacent defects logged, not fixed:
  SpanKind::Region overloads node vs ring spans (label-string parsing only
  discriminator); raster/waterline nodes emit no sub-region events (H4
  attribution region-granular for 2 of 3 bands); Trace/Scallop/SpiralFinish
  still report `regions 0` (same structural class); repo not cargo-fmt clean
  at HEAD (~50 pre-existing sites — left alone).
